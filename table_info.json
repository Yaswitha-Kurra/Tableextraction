In this condition two phases, water and water vapour are considered in simulations with Fluent 6.3. Table 8 shows the comparison between the performance of the propeller in cavitating and non-cavitating conditions. The cavitation number for this cavitating condition is 2.07, which is fairly high, and so the propeller is marginally cavitating and not heavily cavitating. Because of this only a small drop in thrust coefficient was observed in Table 8, when the torque demand was increased slightly. Fig. 14: Pressure distribution on the surface of the blades Table 8.

Fig. 20 shows the contour of pressure coefficient in cavitation condition. When compared with pressure in distribution under non-cavitating conditions in Fig. 15 and Fig. 16, it is slightly increased in Fig 15: Pressure distribution graph at J=1.095 and cavitating condition as shown in Fig. 18 and Fig. 19. The r/R = 0.264 p pressure is expected to remain constant over the cavitating part of the blade. But some change in pressure distribution is observed when propeller started cavitating. However, the phenomenon of constant pressure in the cavitating region was not observed clearly in the Fig. 18 and Fig. 19. This may be because of the fact that cavitation has just initiated or the computational solution could not capture the phenomenon properly. Fig. 21 shows the contour of volume fraction under cavitation condition. From this it is observed that the volume fraction is varying from 0.71 to 1.0. Fig. 22 shows the development of cavities on propeller blade and comparison between CFD and experiments [1]. It clearly shows that water got vaporized in particular area and this particular portion of the propeller blade is made to cavitate. Thus it reduces the thrust generated by the propeller and slight increase the torque Fig 16: Pressure distribution graph at J=1.095 and demand. r/R = 0.704 p 31",
